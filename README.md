# Convolutional-Neural-Networks-for-Direct-Text-Deblurring

● Blurring is a common phenomena
● Blurring can cause loss of information
● Can occur due to various reasons such as defocusing and camera shake

We use a CNN and train it for the restoration of good-quality text images directly from
blurry inputs without assuming any specific blur or noise models.

Here for keeping the input and output same we used same padding and no pooling layers.
For the details of the architecture refer to the pdf file provided with more information.
